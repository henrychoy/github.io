Contents:
1. index.html (this is the home page, please start here)
2. academic.html
3. professional.html
4. hiking.html
5. music.html
6. images folder
7. css folder (contains webstyle and printstyle)
8. CNAME - this is needed to point GitHub Pages to henrychoy.com

What I added this week:
Web and print css will style all pages.  All pages are now hosted on my GitHub and
available at henrychoy.com.  Also made sure I used 7 semantic elements: header, figure,
figcaption, nav, section, article, footer.

The print css makes the following changes from the web version:
1. font - times new roman, which is more readable, also 1.5 spacing, remove all colors
2. nav bar - remove since users can tell what page they're on by header
3. links - remove text decoration, display full URL address will be in parentheses
4. asides - put below articles rather than on the side to help readability
5. video - remove from music page since obviously its not playable

Issues:
1. There is a list on my home page, and whenever I try to remove it, the whole page,
shifts left slightly.  I've been trying to fix it for hours, but I can't figure it out
so for now I've hidden it using css.  Let me know if you can point me in the right
direction.


If any issue please reach me at henrychoy@gmail.com
Thanks!
