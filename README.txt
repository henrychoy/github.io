Contents:
1. index.html (this is the home page, please start here)
2. academic.html
3. professional.html
4. hiking.html
5. music.html
6. images folder
7. css folder (contains webstyle and printstyle)
8. CNAME - this is needed to point GitHub Pages to henrychoy.com

What I added this week:
Web and print css will style all pages.  All pages are now hosted on my GitHub and
available at henrychoy.com.  Also made sure I used 7 semantic elements: header, figure,
figcaption, nav, section, article, footer.  All files validated with no errors.

The print css makes the following changes from the web version:
1. font - times new roman, which is more readable, also 1.5 spacing, remove all colors
2. nav bar - remove since users can tell what page they're on by header
3. links - remove text decoration, display full URL address will be in parentheses
4. asides - put below articles rather than on the side to help readability
5. video - remove from music page since obviously its not playable


If any issue please reach me at henrychoy@gmail.com
Thanks!
