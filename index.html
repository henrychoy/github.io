            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>Hello!  My name is Henry Choy and this is the first webpage that I've built from scratch using HTML and CSS.  As I progress through CS601,
                I'm hoping that I will be able to add more content and make things look nicer, so please check back often!  The main goal of this site is
                to give you an introduction to my academic and professional background, as well as my hobbies outside of work and school.  You can find
                all of these sections in the navigation bar at the top of each page.
