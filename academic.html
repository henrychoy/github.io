    <h3>Graduate Program</h3>
    <h4>Boston University - Masters of Science in Software Development</h4>
    <p>
        I am currently in the Masters of Science in Software Development program at <a href="https://www.bu.edu/met/" target ="_blank">BU Metropolitan College</a>.  I've always had an interest in
        technology and programming ever since I took an intro to java class in undergrad, and with this degree I'm hoping to establish a
        foundation of knowledge that will enable me to jump into the software development field.  CS601 is my 8th and 2nd to last class in
        the MSSD program.  Below are the classes that I've completed so far.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>CS300 - Introduction to Software Development</li>
        <li>CS521 - Information Structures with Python</li>
        <li>CS682 - Information Systems Analysis and Design</li>
        <li>CS526 - Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
        <li>CS622 - Advanced Programming Techniques</li>
        <li>CS665 - Software Design and Patterns</li>
        <li>CS669 - Database Design and Implementation for Business</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Undergraduate Program</h3>
    <h4>Boston University Questrom School of Business - Bachelors of Science in Business Administration</h4>
    <p>
        I completed my undergrad at <a href="http://www.bu.edu/questrom/" target ="_blank">BU Questrom School of Business</a> with a concentration in finance and management information systems.
        The business program provided a broad overview of many business disciplines and culminated in a semester of integrated "CORE"
        classes in junior year of finance, operations management, marketing, and information systems.  I also took many electives that
        weren't directly related to business, such as creative writing, psychology, ethics, and music theory.
