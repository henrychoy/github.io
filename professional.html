        <h3>Mass General Brigham</h3>
        <h4>Application Coordinator</h4>
        <p>
            I currently work as an application coordinator at <a href="https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/" target ="_blank">Mass General Brigham</a> (MGB, previously named Partners Healthcare).  MGB is a
            network of hospitals centered around their two flagship hospitals in Boston: <a href="https://www.massgeneral.org/" target ="_blank">Mass General</a> and <a href="https://www.brighamandwomens.org/" target ="_blank">Brigham & Women's</a>.  Currently they
            are the largest healthcare provider in Massachusetts, treating more than a third of hospital patients in the Boston metro area.  I jumped
            on board when MGB was overhauling all of their sites' electronic medical record systems into a single universal system called Epic.
            My team designs, implements, and supports the module that handles documentation in operating rooms.  Please check out the articles
            on the right to learn more about this project.

        <h3>Epsilon</h3>
        <h4>Business Systems Analyst</h4>
        <p>
            Immediately after graduating from undergrad, I joined a digital marketing company called <a href="https://us.epsilon.com/" target ="_blank">Epsilon</a> as a business systems analyst.
            Epsilon is one of the world's largest digital marketers, sending billions of permission-based messages each year.  My role included
